# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the Requirement Analysis phase of the software development lifecycle. It serves as a comprehensive guide for identifying, defining, and structuring the functional and non-functional requirements of a booking management system. The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario where precise documentation and clear communication of system requirements are critical to successful project execution. Through this project, you'll apply industry-standard practices and tools to create a solid foundation for building scalable software solutions.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project's goals, features, and constraints are systematically identified, examined, and documented. It involves close collaboration between stakeholders, including clients, users, project managers, and developers to ensure a unified understanding of what the software must accomplish.

The process typically includes gathering user needs, eliciting requirements through interviews or surveys, analyzing those requirements for feasibility and consistency, and documenting them in a structured format. Tools like use case diagrams and requirement specification documents are often employed to visualize and communicate these requirements clearly.

### Importance in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis plays a pivotal role in the success of any software project. Here's why:

- **Clarity and Alignment**: It ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and common vision of the product before development begins.
- **Risk Mitigation**: By identifying potential issues early, Requirement Analysis reduces costly rework and scope creep during later development stages.
- **Foundation for Design and Testing**: Well-defined requirements act as a blueprint for designing system architecture and serve as benchmarks for validating and testing the final product.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: When requirements are clearly understood, resources like time, manpower, and budget can be allocated more effectively.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase is composed of several critical activities that guide the development team from initial discovery to validated understanding of what the software should achieve. Each activity contributes to building a strong foundation for software design and implementation.

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial step where information is collected from all relevant sources clients, users, existing systems, and documentation. The focus is on identifying problems, goals, and user expectations. This data serves as raw input for more structured analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Building upon gathered data, elicitation digs deeper into stakeholder needs through techniques such as interviews, workshops, questionnaires, and prototyping. This process helps to uncover implicit, hidden, or conflicting requirements that may not be immediately obvious.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All elicited and validated requirements are formally recorded in structured formats like Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, and use cases. This ensures traceability, reduces ambiguity, and serves as a reference throughout the software development lifecycle.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  At this stage, the documented requirements are critically examined for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and priority. Modeling techniques such as UML diagrams, flowcharts, or entity-relationship diagrams are used to visually represent system behavior and data relationships.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Validation ensures that the documented requirements align with stakeholder expectations and business objectives. Techniques like requirement reviews, walkthroughs, and acceptance criteria are applied to confirm accuracy, clarity, and testability before moving forward to design and implementation.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific behavior and functions the system should perform. These are directly related to user interactions, data handling, and business logic.

Examples for the hotel booking project:
- 🔍 **Search and Filter Hotels**: Customers should be able to search hotels using filters like location, price range, amenities, and availability.
- 🏨 **Manage Hotel Listings**: Hotel managers can add, update, or remove hotel details such as room types, pricing, images, and availability.
- 🛎️ **Booking Functionality**: Users should be able to book a selected room for specific dates and receive a confirmation.
- 💳 **Payment Integration**: The system should support online payments through a third-party payment gateway.
- 📩 **Notifications Service**: Customers and managers must receive real-time booking updates and promotional notifications.
- 📅 **View Booking History**: Users (both customers and managers) should be able to view past and upcoming bookings.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions. These include performance, scalability, usability, and reliability.

Examples for the hotel booking project:
- ⚡ **Performance and Speed**: APIs should respond within milliseconds, aided by caching layers like Redis to speed up data retrieval.
- 📈 **Scalability**: The system must handle increasing loads using a microservices architecture and distributed databases like Cassandra for archival.
- 🔒 **Security**: User data and payment information should be secured with proper encryption and compliance with data protection laws.
- 🌍 **Availability and Reliability**: Services should maintain high availability through load balancing and database replication (master-slave).
- 🌐 **Content Delivery Optimization**: Use of CDN ensures rapid delivery of hotel media content across geographies.
- 🔄 **Data Consistency and Syncing**: Updates made to hotel data must be reflected across all services using messaging queues like Kafka.

## Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?
🧩 A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of a system’s functionalities and interactions from the user’s perspective. It illustrates:
- Actors (users or systems that interact with the application)
- Use cases (specific actions or services the system provides)
- Relationships between actors and use cases

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
✅ Use Case Diagrams help in:
- Clearly defining system scope and boundaries
- Identifying required features based on user interactions
- Improving communication between stakeholders and developers
- Serving as a foundation for creating test cases and documentation

### Use Case Diagram for Booking System
Below is a Use Case Diagram representing key functionalities of the hotel booking management system. Actors include `Customer`, `Hotel Manager`, and `Payment Gateway`. Use cases include `Search Hotels`, `Book Hotel`, `Make Payment`, `Manage Listings`, and `View Bookings`.

## Acceptance Criteria

### What is Acceptance Criteria?
✅ Acceptance Criteria are specific conditions that a feature or functionality must satisfy to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They serve as a bridge between user expectations and development goals during requirement analysis.

### Importance in Requirement Analysis
Acceptance Criteria play a crucial role in:
- 🔍 **Defining Success**: They clearly articulate when a feature meets user needs and business goals.
- ✅ **Setting Boundaries**: Helps avoid scope creep by defining what is and isn’t included in a feature.
- 🧪 **Facilitating Testing**: Enables creation of test cases to verify feature correctness.
- 🤝 **Aligning Teams**: Ensures that developers, designers, and stakeholders have a shared understanding of functionality.

### Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria
Below is a sample acceptance criteria for the **Checkout** feature in the booking management system:

- 🛒 **User can initiate checkout** after selecting a hotel room and entering booking details.
- 💳 **User must be able to choose a payment method** (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet, etc.).
- 🔐 **Payment information is transmitted securely** using HTTPS and encryption standards.
- 💥 **System handles payment errors gracefully**, showing appropriate error messages (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid card).
- 📧 **User receives a booking confirmation via email** immediately after successful payment.
- 🧾 **Booking details are saved and viewable** in the user's booking history.
- ⏱️ **Checkout transaction completes within 5 seconds** under normal server load conditions.
